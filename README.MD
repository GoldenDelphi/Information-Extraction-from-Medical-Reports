<h1 align="center">  Information Extraction and Retrieval from Medical and Clinical Trials/Reports </h1>
Created a simple interface which helps extract and visualize important information like symptoms and drug dosages from unstructured clinical trials, using NLP, which can prove detrimental in life and death situations.


## About the Project:
Medical professionals keep track of and monitor the clinical trials and medical report data. Due to the enormous amount of data in these documents, it can be difficult to identify relevant information. 
Having access to such verified medical information is essential when making decisions that could save lives, hence to save this time which is very crucial while saving lives, in our project we propose to use NLP, involving concepts of named entity recognition and rule-based matching in order to filter out relevant information like symptoms, past medical and allergies from medical records.
By breaking sentences into tokens, labeling these tokens, and exploring relationships we are able to classify words into relevant categories, which will allow us to flag relevant information in specific types, also allowing us to store this data in a machine-friendly format which can be operated on by data manipulation software. This helps us identify trends and establish relationships in an easier way and would allow medical practitioners to make decisions and diagnoses quickly.
